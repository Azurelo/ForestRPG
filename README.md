# Forest RPG

## Description of the Software
I wanted to create a text-based role-playing game
(RPG) that involves character creation, battles,
and a simple storyline. The goal of this project
is to build a game where the player engages in
combat with enemies, makes strategic choices,
and experiences basic game mechanics, such as
attacking and defending. 

## Purpose
With this project I aimed to explore Java 
syntax, classes and methods, and user interaction, 
enhancing my problem-solving and coding 
capabilities.
